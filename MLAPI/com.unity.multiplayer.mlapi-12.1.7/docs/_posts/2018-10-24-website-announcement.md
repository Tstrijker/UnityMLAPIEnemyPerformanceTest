Welcome to the new website!

This is one step in a more community oriented direction for the MLAPI. The documentation will now be hosted on this website, which means that the community can help and improve it!


In addition to the new website with documentation and announcement / blog functionality. We have launched a mailing list where we will announce new features, releases and general networking news (not just MLAPI stuff).


**The documentation is currently migrated from the GitHub Wiki to this website. Anyone who wants to help improve the documentation is welcome to!**
